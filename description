A safety lock system is created by using verilog and implemented on FPGA.
The lock gets opened if the pin didgits provided are correct or else it shows error message.
If the owner of the lock is present then the system requires an 8 digit code else it requires a 10 didgit code for security reasons.
The 2 digit code is given by the bank at the time of opening the deposit.
In this way safety lock is designed and implemented on FPGA board succesfully.
