FPGA SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT LOCK:
This project implements a safety lock deposit vault using an FPGA.
The lock mechanism is controlled by an 8-digit code system, ensuring high security and flexibility. The main features include:

8 digit code system:
Owner: 4-digit code
President: 4-digit code
Managers: Two managers, each with a 2-digit code

10-Digit Code Override:

If the owner is absent, the lock requires a 10-digit code to be opened, combining the president's 4-digit code and
the two managers' 2-digit codes plus a random number which is generated at the time of opening a deposit.

This project demonstrates a practical application of FPGA in security systems, with VHDL/Verilog code 
for the implementation, test benches for simulation, and documentation for ease of understanding and reproduction.
